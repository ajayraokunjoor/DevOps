# User Creation Script Documentation

This script automates the creation of a new Linux user with a home directory, password, and default configuration files.

## Purpose
- Creates a new system user with specified credentials
- Sets up home directory with default skeleton files
- Verifies user creation and configuration

## Prerequisites
- Must be executed with **root privileges**
- Requires `bash` shell environment

## Usage Example
```bash
sudo ./create_user.sh
# Follow prompts for username and password
```

## Script Breakdown

### 1. Root Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "This script must be run as root"
  exit 1
fi
```
- Ensures script runs with root privileges (`sudo` required)
- Prevents permission errors during user creation

### 2. User Input
```bash
read -p "Enter username: " USERNAME
read -s -p "Enter password: " PASSWORD
echo
```
- Prompts for username (visible input)
- Prompts for password (hidden input using `-s` flag)

### 3. User Creation
```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$USERNAME"
```
- `-m`: Creates home directory (`/home/<username>`)
- `-s /bin/bash`: Sets default shell to Bash

### 4. Error Handling
```bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to create user $USERNAME"
  exit 1
fi
```
- Checks if previous command succeeded
- Exits with error code 1 on failure

### 5. Password Configuration
```bash
echo "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" | chpasswd
```
- Sets password using `chpasswd` utility
- More secure than `passwd` for scripting

### 6. Home Directory Setup
```bash
cp -r /etc/skel/* /home/"$USERNAME"
chown -R "$USERNAME":"$USERNAME" /home/"$USERNAME"
```
- Copies skeleton files (default configs from `/etc/skel`)
- Sets proper ownership of home directory

### 7. Verification
```bash
echo "User $USERNAME has been created successfully."
id "$USERNAME"
```
- Confirms successful creation
- Displays user information for verification

## Security Considerations
1. **Password Visibility**: While `-s` hides input, passwords might still be visible in process lists
2. **Credential Storage**: Never store passwords in scripts
3. **Root Access**: Always audit scripts requiring root privileges

## Best Practices
```bash
# For production environments, consider:
# 1. Using SSH keys instead of passwords
# 2. Implementing password complexity checks
# 3. Using Ansible Vault for credential management
```
